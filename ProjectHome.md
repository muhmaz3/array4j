# Introduction #
array4j is a vector, matrix and N-dimensional array library for Java that combines ideas from [JAMA](http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/), [Matrix Toolkits for Java](http://ressim.berlios.de/), [JScience](http://www.jscience.org/) and [NumPy](http://www.scipy.org/).

array4j uses [Java Native Access (JNA)](https://jna.dev.java.net/) to interface with vendor BLAS implementations such as Intel MKL and AMD ACML.
